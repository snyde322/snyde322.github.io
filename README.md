<h3>Service Overview<h3>
  
<p>At Coltivare, we turn <u> data into <i> <b> intellegence .</b> </i> Our services provide ease and access to making smarter, better decisions. We will provide a no-hassle installation service along with personalized training. This will allow every farmer to learn the ropes and use our system with minute growing pains.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> Drone Imaging </h3>
  
  <p>Our services include deploying high-quality drones to your farm. These drones will take pictures and videos of fields and herds. Our services can be scheduled regularly at the same time every year, or they can be used as needed in order to suit every farmer's needs.</p>
  <p>With our drones, farmers can see their land in a new way, and can reduce costs by identifying areas of concern before they become too drastic of a problem.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> Installation </h3>
  
  <p> When you choose to receive our premium services, we handle the setup all the way through. We will deliver drone equipment, make sure our Coltview system is running smoothly, and personally ensure that our systems are completely in sync with your land. After all of the setup, tests will be done to make sure that no issues will arise while our system is in place. </p>
